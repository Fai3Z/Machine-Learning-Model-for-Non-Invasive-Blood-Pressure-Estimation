# Machine-Learning-Model-for-Non-Invasive-Blood-Pressure-Estimation
A project where we worked on a portable Electronics based solution that measures (estimates) BP (systolic/diastolic) in a non-invasive manner using several basic ML and DL algorithms. The data used to train model is present as data (1).csv and code is in notebook.
It was an industrial solution so Microcontroller code is not shared here.

We used Buck converter, Arduino Nano, and Max30102 Oximeter sensor
